I found an issue when testing on a device with iOS 13.3.1 due to using a CocoaPod that has Alamofire as a dependency, most likely due to RxAlamofire. I thought it was due to my code but it with the Signing of a Pod which uses the Alamofire pod as a dependency, and is specifically happening on a device with that iOS version. Maybe you have already had the problem since you use RxAlamofire. If so, I'd recommend not upgrading any device until it has been solved otherwise you can only test with the simulator, like I was doing before coming across this bug.

I am still ironing out some issues with the code that I thought would have been completed yesterday. Feel free to review my code as is whilst I finish the final corrections over the next few hours. It has been more challenging than I thought deciding to add Core Data and synchronising the data but that was my decision to show you my experience and I will complete it today. Once updated I'll advise you here.

Hopefully you will be willing to review my final product and still consider me for the position.

Thanks,
Robert
